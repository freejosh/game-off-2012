Prototype of game mechanic in which the player can be cloned, choosing to increase an attribute in the clone and decreasing that attribute in the original copy.

The idea for a game around this mechanic is a puzzle platformer where all clones must reach the end of the level for the player to succeed. Puzzles would necessitate using the cloning mechanic to reach a new area of the level with that clone, and finding a way to help the other copies to the finish line (for example increasing the jump attribute to reach a switch that produces stairs). The cloned abilities would also stack, so more advanced puzzles would rely on increasing the correct attribute on the correct clone (e.g. a puzzle would require a clone with both speed and jump).

Controls:

* Move left: <kbd>&larr;</kbd> or <kbd>A</kbd>
* Move right: <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> or <kbd>D</kbd>
* Jump: <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>W</kbd>
* Clone player: <kbd>C</kbd>
* Switch controls between clones: <kbd>R</kbd>
